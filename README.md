# Jacob's Ladder - Space Elevator Research and Design

> *"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."* - Genesis 28:12

## Overview

Jacob's Ladder is a comprehensive research and design project dedicated to developing a functional space elevator - a revolutionary space transportation system that could fundamentally transform humanity's access to space. Named after the biblical prophet Jacob's dream of a ladder ascending to heaven, this project aims to turn that ancient vision into modern reality.

## Project Vision

The goal of Jacob's Ladder is to create a detailed, scientifically rigorous design for a space elevator that can:
- Provide cost-effective access to orbit and beyond
- Enable mass transportation of cargo and personnel to space
- Reduce the environmental impact of space launches
- Establish a permanent infrastructure for space exploration and development

## What is a Space Elevator?

A space elevator is a proposed type of planet-to-space transportation system consisting of a cable anchored to Earth's surface and extending into space. Climbers would ascend the cable to reach orbit without the need for traditional rocket propulsion. The concept promises to reduce the cost of reaching space by orders of magnitude.
