# Project Overview

## Mission Statement

Jacob's Ladder aims to design a scientifically feasible, economically viable space elevator system that will revolutionize access to space and enable humanity's expansion beyond Earth.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. Develop comprehensive technical specifications for a space elevator system
2. Identify and solve key engineering challenges
3. Create detailed designs for all major components
4. Conduct rigorous safety and risk analysis
5. Demonstrate economic feasibility

### Long-term Vision
- Enable cost-effective space transportation (< $100/kg to orbit)
- Support permanent space infrastructure development
- Facilitate large-scale space manufacturing and resource utilization
- Create pathways for space tourism and settlement
- Reduce environmental impact of space access

## Biblical Inspiration

The project takes its name from Jacob's Ladder, described in Genesis 28:12, where Jacob dreams of a ladder reaching from earth to heaven with angels ascending and descending. This ancient vision of a connection between earth and the heavens serves as a powerful metaphor for our modern engineering challenge.

Just as Jacob's ladder represented a pathway between the earthly and divine realms, our space elevator represents humanity's pathway to the cosmos - a permanent bridge that transforms space from an occasionally visited frontier into an accessible extension of human civilization.

## Why a Space Elevator?

### Current Limitations
- Rocket launches cost $2,000-20,000+ per kilogram to orbit
- Chemical rockets are inherently inefficient (90%+ propellant by mass)
- Limited launch frequency and payload capacity
- Significant environmental impact
- High risk and complexity

### Space Elevator Advantages
- Estimated costs: $100-500/kg (90-99% reduction)
- Continuous operations possible
- Reusable infrastructure
- Lower environmental impact
- Safer than explosive rocket propulsion
- Enables mass transportation of cargo and personnel

## Technical Approach

Our approach combines:
1. **Material Science Research** - Advanced materials capable of withstanding the required tensile strength
2. **Systems Engineering** - Integrated design of all components
3. **Risk Management** - Comprehensive safety analysis and mitigation strategies
4. **Economic Modeling** - Realistic cost projections and business models
5. **Incremental Development** - Phased approach with testable milestones

## Project Status

Jacob's Ladder is currently in the early research and design phase. We are:
- Documenting technical requirements
- Reviewing current state of relevant technologies
- Identifying key challenges and gaps
- Developing preliminary designs
- Building a community of contributors

## Success Criteria

This project will be considered successful when:
1. A complete, peer-reviewable technical design is published
2. All major engineering challenges have viable solutions
3. Economic analysis demonstrates feasibility
4. Safety analysis shows acceptable risk levels
5. The design serves as a foundation for future development efforts

## Collaboration and Openness

Jacob's Ladder is an open project. We believe that solving one of humanity's greatest engineering challenges requires collaboration across disciplines, institutions, and borders. All research, designs, and analysis will be freely available to advance the collective goal of making space accessible to all.
