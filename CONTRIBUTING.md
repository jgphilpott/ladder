## Contribution Process

### For Documentation and Research

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a new branch** for your contribution
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-contribution-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing document structure and style
   - Use clear, technical language
   - Include citations for references
4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your contribution"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-contribution-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description of your contribution
   - Explain the significance and relevance
   - Reference any related issues

### For Code and Simulations

1. Follow the same git workflow as above
2. **Include documentation** for any code:
   - Comments explaining complex logic
   - README files for scripts and tools
   - Usage instructions and examples
3. **Include test cases** where applicable
4. **Ensure reproducibility** of simulations:
   - Document dependencies and versions
   - Provide sample data or parameters
   - Include instructions for running

## Style Guidelines

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, technical language
- Define acronyms on first use
- Include units for all numerical values
- Cite sources using standard academic format
- Use Markdown formatting consistently

### File Organization

- Place documents in appropriate directories:
  - `/docs` - Technical documentation and specifications
  - `/research` - Research papers and analysis
  - `/design` - Engineering designs and schematics
  - `/analysis` - Computational models and simulations

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Update, Fix, Remove)
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Provide details in the body if needed

Examples:
```
Add material properties for boron nitride nanotubes
Update cable stress analysis with new safety factors
Fix calculation error in deployment timeline
Remove outdated cost estimates
```

## Quality Standards

### Research Contributions

- Base claims on peer-reviewed sources when possible
- Clearly distinguish between established facts and speculation
- Include proper citations and references
- Acknowledge uncertainties and limitations
- Present multiple viewpoints for controversial topics

### Design Contributions

- Ensure designs are technically feasible
- Include specifications and parameters
- Consider safety and reliability
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Provide justification for design choices

### Code Contributions

- Write clean, well-documented code
- Follow best practices for the language used
- Include error handling
- Test thoroughly before submitting
- Document dependencies and requirements
