# Key Technical Challenges

## Overview

While the space elevator is theoretically feasible, numerous significant technical challenges must be overcome before construction can begin. This document outlines the major obstacles and proposes solutions or research directions for each.

## 1. Materials Science Challenge

### The Problem
**Status**: CRITICAL PATH ITEM

The cable must support its own weight hanging from geostationary orbit (35,786 km) while carrying climbers. This requires:
- Specific strength > 25 MN·m/kg
- Length: 100,000 km of high-quality material
- Mass: 1-10 million metric tons
- Zero-defect manufacturing for critical sections

**Current Situation**:
- Carbon nanotubes have sufficient theoretical strength (70 MN·m/kg)
- Practical CNT cables achieve only 10-20% of theoretical strength
